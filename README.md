## How do I approach designing software?

When trying to design software I try to create a plan that makes sure my code is maintainable, readable, and efficient. During the process of this project I have been able to reinforce the principles of clean code by creating methods that are reusable, clean, and self-explanatory in name. My time spent on this project will help me in future endeavors by helping me cement strong coding fundamentals and design philosophies.

## How do I approach developing programs?

My approach to developing programs is to start with the basic idea of what I am trying to achieve as fast as possible as to build a basic piece of work that I can build off until I have completed the vision I have for a given project.  I tend to develop code using an iterative process working of the base model I have made slowly adding to the work until completion solving problems that arise as I go. In my view you could spend all day reading documentation on a framework you are working on but nothing will teach you faster and build stronger fundamentals than jumping right in and learning as you work through each problem you run into.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science will help me reach my goal of becoming a software engineer as it is the base of the field I want to eventually become an expert in and make a living off of. The techniques and fundamentals of the OpenGl framework and computer graphics in general that I have learned this course will help me immensely in future endeavors, it has especially opened up a wider range of things I could potentially work on with experience in both 2d and 3d graphics and visualization projects.
